# Prashikshan_2017
In this task we are given to make a autonomous robot that contains

1- IR Sensor
2- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
3- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor

Arduino UNO micro Controller

In this task we have to make a Line follower bot which will follow line but when ever any junction comes
it will print the various way to move ahead like if the junction is cross juntion then it will print on the screen

You can go LEFT or RIGHT
then the operator will give command by the switchs on the screen

Simultanously it draws the path in the Processing IDE thus it helps the operator to understand the arena.

It will reverse it's path whenever any obstacle will come in front of it  by the help of HC-SR04
